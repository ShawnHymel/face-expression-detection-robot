# Face Expression (Emotion) Detection Robot

This project demonstrates training a face expression/emotion detection model (based on YOLOv8-nano) and deploying it to an Arduino UNO Q to control a robot (stationary pan/tilt mount).

## Training

Note that I've tested this on an MSI laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU running on Linux Mint 21.3. The training script has a switch that you can set to enable training on the GPU vs the CPU (if you do not have access to a GPU).
